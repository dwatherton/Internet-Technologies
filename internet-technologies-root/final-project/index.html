			<p>Skateboarding Resources is an online resource designed to provide information on skateboarding products and parks. In the digital age we felt the need to provide everyday skateboarders with access to everything they could need at the click of a button.
				This site is designed by skateboarders for skateboarders.</p>

			<p>As part of our goal to inform skateboarders, we have picked out the most critical things that skateboarders need to know to really have a good time and put them all in one place. The things that we find the most vital are skateboard parts and locations
				to skateboard.</p>

			<p>If you have any questions or concerns please <a href="mailto:dwatherton@ualr.edu" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a> and we will do our best to help you as soon as possible!</p>
			<!--For this website I have used the generic "mailto:" attribute, however I know that prompting the user to have to resort to their computers default email program is not always ideal.-->
